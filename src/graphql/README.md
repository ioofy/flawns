# Why we using Graphql Codegen?

GraphQL Code Generator is a tool for generating code out of a GraphQL schema and GraphQL operations (query / mutation / subscription).

You can use GraphQL Code Generator in many development environments - it can integrate with your project, or just act as a utility tool.

When developers use GraphQL, they often need a way to integrate the GraphQL language (called GraphQL SDL) with their development platform (for example: if you are working in a TypeScript project, you can generate typings based on your GraphQL schema or operations, to leverage type-safety).

GraphQL Code Generator was built to address exactly that. By analyzing and parsing the GraphQL schema and operations, GraphQL Code Generator can output code at a wide variety of formats, based on pre-defined plugins or based on custom user-defined ones.

Regardless of the language/environment that you're using, GraphQL Code Generator got you covered.

It make our app easy to maintain and integrate with typescript because when we generate a new graphql it will make a interface or type that we can using it.
